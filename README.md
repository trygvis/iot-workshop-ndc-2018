This is the materials for a 1 hour workshop on IoT.

> *Connect your Arduino to the internet.*
>
> In this workshop we will use a production quality device in a
> developer friendly package and connect it to the internet. We will
> cover the Arduino APIs for wifi and MQTT and use these to get the
> device to send and react on messages.
>
> Basic programming knowledge and some Arduino experience is assumed.
> We will not focus much on the electronics aspects of the board, but
> that will be covered in the "Getting Started With Arduino" workshop.
>
> Requirements: 
> You will need an Arduino-kit to attend this workshop. The kit can be
> purchased for 300NOK at the Bitraf stand.
>
> There are some software that you should have installed, check with
> the person at the Bitraf stand.
